# Discord-MC-Server-Start
Script that let's you run a .bat file to start your MC server by issuing a command from your Discord server, so fairly niche use-case. I have it set to start when my PC starts, it takes up about 20 MB RAM in the background, so minimal memory usage.

I HIGHLY suggest using the DiscordSRV plugin(https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/discordsrv.18494/) to achieve near-complete Discord integration with Minecraft. 

Set-up Process:
Create a Discord bot for your server, put it's token in the script.
Configure the script to run the Batch file, just copy file location and paste it in.
Put this script into the folder that contains your Minecraft Server, and you're done.

To-Do:

* Create a GUI that makes setup easier. 
* Improve tutorial with pictures/video

Support:
Project is new so tutorial and the script itself are pretty bare-bones, so contact me on Discord if you need help. Zexoi#1699
